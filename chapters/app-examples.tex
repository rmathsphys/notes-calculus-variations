\section{More Examples of Variational Problems}
Shortest path on R2, shortest path on S2, Path of least time, caternary: least energy, fermat's principle in optics, specific systems from CM and theoretical engineering, least area with fixed perimeter. Geodesics.

Advanced theoretical physics (String theory: Nambu-Gato action, Maxwell's equations from the action, comment about the lagrangian for the standard model).
